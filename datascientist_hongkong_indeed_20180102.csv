Overview:
In short, they are building a brand new trade advisory platform for private banking clients. The core concept is based on a data lake, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and a brand new Full Stack tech platform to support it and tie it all together.
The idea is that they want to use technology to simplify the way trade suggestions and advice is collated and presented to clients. This new system will create documents (emails, web sites, smartphone apps, etc) that will bundle together all of the necessary data, risk, research and information to present to clients. It will do this in record breaking time, removing the arduous and time costly process of gathering this information and analyzing it in person, meaning my client can be fastest to market. It will work within the client’s risk parameters and be able to access and include all relevant research and analysis at the click of a button.
A little further down the line, this system will begin to start making investment proposals by itself, by using Machine Learning and AI. Any trade or decision ever made by that client, or any similar client, before will have been stored in the data lake. The system will work with that data and real-time incoming data to predict and suggest the most suitable and interesting trade ideas to clients in real-time.

The roles:
Full Stack Developers
They are looking for passionate full stack software engineers to join a lean, agile, fast moving tech-loving team. As an experienced web dev you will be working closely with business users to build out a next generation trade advisory platform to be used by over 1k users across the investment and private bank. You will be a key contributor to architecting and delivering the product to our users.
Essential: Node.js, Javascript, reactjs (or another UI framework), HTML5, CSS, RESTFull APIs, experience of agile working (TDD, testing, CI, kanban)
Great to have: GraphQL, webpack, redux, es6, babel, selenium, MongoDB, knowledge of responsive design (for mobile, experience with working with UX designers
Data Scientists
Experienced data scientist to work on an exciting green field trade recommendation engine that will have profound impact on certain areas of the business. You will be working with data in a newly built data lake and your skills and experience in the areas below will make you a key contributor to architecting and building out the product.
